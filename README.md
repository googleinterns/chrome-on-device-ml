# Motivation
The competitiveness of browsers in future will be determined by empowering the
user to control their data’s privacy while being optimized for lightening fast
user-interactions. AI has enabled web applications to offer several new
features, for example text suggestions or recommending the next video to watch.
ML models require user data to train accurate models which directly conflicts
with empowering users’ privacy.  On-device ML enables new paradigm empowering
users to control their privacy because the user data never leaves their device
and the deployed models may be personalized if the user would like to. So far
Google has seen successful deployment of on-device ML models in a wide-range of
applications, including Nest, Assistant, Gmail, and Youtube.  In this intern
project, we investigate the regime in which on-device ML models can be
successfully deployed in Chrome to enable new capabilities & features. Mobile
browsers introduce additional systems challenges related to memory and/or
latency constraints that require investigation for on-device ML models to
perform well.
